# Dynamic configuration of Spring managed beans - showcase

This project has been created for demonstration purposes.
It uses a made-up scenario - a **web crawler service** with custom HTTP clients.

Please see particular project branches to learn how this topic can be approached from different angles.

#### Note: *main* branch lacks required configuration components thus will not build (tests will fail intentionally).
